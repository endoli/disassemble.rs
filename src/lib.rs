//! # Disassemble
//!
//! This crate provides basic functionality for working with
//! disassembled code. It provides (or will provide) functionality
//! for performing:
//!
//! * Working with code that has already been compiled to machine
//!   code for any CPU, bytecode, compiler IR or JIT compiler
//!   output like that of V8 or the JVM. You provide an adapter
//!   to teach [`Instruction`] how to report the correct information
//!   for your generated code.
//! * Reconstructing the [control flow graph] from a body of compiled
//!   code.
//! * **(Future)** Reconstructing loops and higher level control
//!   flow constructs.
//! * **(Future)** Performing [data flow analysis].
//! * **(Future)** Generating HTML and other rich output formats
//!   to assist in visualizing structure and higher level presentations
//!   of the data derived from the generated code.
//! * **(Future)** Writing decompilers that generate C or
//!   other languages from lower level generated code.
//! * **(Future)** Writing tools for reverse engineering. Many tools
//!   for reverse engineering require extracting and inferring higher
//!   level structure from the low level generated code. This crate
//!   provides those capabilities for re-use by anyone.
//! * **(Future)** Writing views that display disassembled code for
//!   debuggers, profilers and other systems level tools.
//!
//! The actual disassembly with the implementation of [`Instruction`]
//! and other elements of the system will be provided by other
//! crates that integrate with other systems, such as the [Capstone
//! Engine]. This crate is written such that it should work with
//! nearly any machine code, VM bytecode or JIT compiler output,
//! given an appropriate implementation of [`Instruction`].
//!
//! It is possible (likely?) that some functionality from within
//! this crate may move in the future to a separate crate for broader
//! re-use. This might impact [`Symbol`] among other things.
//!
//! ## Installation
//!
//! This crate works with Cargo and is on
//! [crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/disassemble).
//! Add it to your `Cargo.toml` like so:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! disassemble = "0.0.1"
//! ```
//!
//! Then, let `rustc` know that you're going to use this crate at the
//! top of your own crate:
//!
//! ```
//! extern crate disassemble;
//! # fn main() {}
//! ```
//!
//! ## Future Directions
//!
//! In the future, we want to extend this library to support a number of
//! additional features:
//!
//! * Implement DOT output for the [`ControlFlowGraph`]. This can probably be done with the
//!   help of [`petgraph`].
//! * HTML output modes?
//! * Implement loop finding. (Havlak)
//! * Implement the [Capstone Engine] backend as a separate crate.
//! * Make [`Instruction`] aware of operands, registers
//! * Data flow support. Memory SSA?
//! * Should we deal with mangled symbols at this level?
//! * So much more!
//!
